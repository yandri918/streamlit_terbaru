### Week 2: Technical Deep Dive
```
🔧 How I integrated 3 different AI modalities into one platform

Building AgriSensa taught me that the real challenge isn't training models—it's orchestrating multiple AI services into a cohesive product.

Here's what I learned:

1️⃣ LLM Integration (Google Gemini)
- Context management for multi-turn conversations
- Prompt engineering for domain-specific responses
- Error handling for API rate limits

2️⃣ Computer Vision (Roboflow)
- Real-time image processing pipeline
- Confidence threshold tuning
- Fallback strategies for low-quality images

3️⃣ Predictive ML (scikit-learn)
- Feature engineering from real-time APIs
- Model versioning and updates
- Explainable predictions with SHAP

The key? Treating each AI service as a microservice with clear interfaces.

What's your approach to multi-modal AI?

### Week 3: Share Learning
```
📚 5 lessons from deploying ML models to production

After shipping AgriSensa (25+ AI modules, 99.5% uptime), here's what I wish I knew earlier:

1. Monitoring > Accuracy
   Your 95% accurate model is useless if you don't know when it fails

2. Graceful Degradation
   Always have a fallback when APIs fail

3. User Feedback Loop
   Real users will find edge cases you never imagined

4. Documentation = Future You's Best Friend
   6 months later, you won't remember why you made that decision

5. Ship Fast, Iterate Faster
   Perfect is the enemy of shipped

What's your biggest production ML lesson?

```

### Week 4: Engagement Post
```
🤔 Question for AI Engineers:

What's harder:
A) Building an accurate ML model
B) Deploying it to production
C) Maintaining it over time

My vote: C

Building AgriSensa taught me that the real work starts AFTER deployment:
- API changes break integrations
- User behavior evolves
- Data drift degrades accuracy
- New edge cases emerge

How do you handle production ML maintenance?
